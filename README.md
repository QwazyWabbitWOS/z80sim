z80sim
======

A simulator and debugger for the Z80 processor.

This fork enhances the 'step' function in the debugger
and adds Visual Studio 2017 project files.
Some logic errors are fixed and the formatting of
code is aligned to a more standard style for debugging
purposes.
Help display is a bit more explanatory.
